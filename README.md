# high-level-design-lab

A collection of system design explorations, diagrams, and notes as I learn how to design scalable and reliable systems.
Each folder documents a different system, covering core components, trade-offs, and high-level architecture.

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Build a personal knowledge base of system design patterns and practices.
