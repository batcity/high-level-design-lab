# Problem framing:

Design WhatsApp (core messaging). Scope only what’s needed for a v1 that still feels “WhatsApp-y”.

## In-scope features / Functional Requirements

- 1:1 chats, group chats (up to 1,024 members)  
- Text, images, videos, voice notes (media up to 100 MB)
- Delivery receipts (✓ sent, ✓✓ delivered, ✓✓ blue read)
- Presence (online/last seen/typing), push notifications  
- End-to-end encryption (Signal protocol family)
- Multi-device (phone + up to 3 companion devices)  
- Offline support and message ordering
