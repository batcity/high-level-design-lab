# ⚙️ Critical Flows (URL shortener system)

This section documents the core end-to-end flows in URL-Shortener system. It emphasizes **session-based authentication**, converting URLs to short URLs and redirecting to the original URLs when a short URL is hit


## 🔑 0. User Login (Note: User doesn't have to login to create short URLs, this is only for additional features where the User can view all the short URLs they've created in their dashboard)

**Goal:** Authenticate the user and issue a token for subsequent requests.  

| Step | Component                             | Action                                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **User → API Gateway → Auth Service** | POST `/login` with email/password                 |
| 2    | **Auth Service**                      | Validates credentials, generates JWT              |
| 3    | **API Gateway → User**                | Returns JWT                                       |
| 4    | **User → API Gateway → URL Service**  | Sends requests with `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` |
| 5    | **API Gateway**                       | Validates token (signature + expiry)              |
| 6    | **URL Service**                       | Uses `user_id` claim to fetch URLs                |

**JWT Token:** A JWT (JSON Web Token) consists of three dot-separated parts — header, payload, and signature.  
The signature is generated by hashing (and signing) the header and payload using a secret key or private key.  
When the server validates a request, it recomputes the signature from the header and payload using its own key and compares it against the token’s signature.
If they match, the token is authentic and unmodified.
This means an attacker cannot alter the payload (for example, changing "admin": false to "admin": true") — because any change to the payload would produce a different signature, and without the secret key, the attacker can’t generate a matching one.

## 1. Creating Short URLs:

| Step | Component                             | Action                                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **User → API Gateway → URL shortener service** | 
| 2    | **URL shortener**                      | Generates a Shortened URL |
| 3    | **API Gateway → User**                | Returns the shortened URL

## 2. Redirect User to original URL:

| Step | Component | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| 1 | **User → API Gateway → URL Shortener Service** | Sends a **GET** request with the short code (e.g., `short.url/xyz`). |
| 2 | **URL Shortener** | Looks up the short code (`xyz`) in the data store to retrieve the original long URL. |
| 3 | **URL Shortener → API Gateway → User** | Sends an **HTTP 302 Found** (or **301 Moved Permanently**) response, setting the `Location` header to the original long URL. |
| 4 | **User (Browser)** | Automatically interprets the 302 response and sends a new **GET** request to the URL specified in the `Location` header. |

## 3. Access saved URLs:

Note: These actions would only be allowed after the user logs in to the service

| Step | Component | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| 1 | **User → API Gateway → URL Shortener Service** | This view lets the user view all their saved URLs using an endpoint such as a GET /userId/savedURLs |
| 2 | **URL Shortener** | Looks up the URLs saved by the user  in the data store and retrieves them.|


## 4. save a URL to their dashboard:

Note: These actions would only be allowed after the user logs in to the service

| Step | Component | Action |
|------|------------|--------|
| 1 | **User → API Gateway → URL Shortener Service** | user Sends a shortened URL along with the original URL using an endpoint such as a POST /userId/savedURL to save it in the datastore |
| 2 | **URL Shortener** | Saves the URL in the datastore and returns a 200 to indicate that the save request was successful.|
