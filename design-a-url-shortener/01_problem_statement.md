# Problem framing:

Design a URL shortener

## In-scope features / Functional Requirements

- given a URL, the url shortener should provide a shortened URL
- When the short URL is visited, redirect the user to the original long URL
- The user should have the ability to create/maintain and account and view the list of URLs they've created in the past
